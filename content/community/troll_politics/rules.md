In addition to the usual Snoonet network rules, follow the channel rules:

1. DON'T BE A SHITWEASEL. Mods reserve the right to interpret shitweaselness.
2. No sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, harassment or rudeness will be tolerated.
3. If you are experiencing current harassment in the chat, whether in the main room or private chat, please copy the log and email the transcript to an active op, or if none are available to Ops@TrollChromosomes.com and the mods will respond appropriately.
4. No unsolicited PMs. This means you.
5. Do not advertise. This includes, but is not limited to, public spam, private message spam, repeated solicitation of services, and solicitation of other network channels.
6. Posting the personal information of others is grounds for a permanent ban. Attempting to collect personal info of users is dealt with in the same manner. A good rule of thumb is if you have to log into to see it, you shouldn't share it.
7. Exchanges for money, goods, or services are strictly prohibited.
8. No NSFW links allowed unless it relates to political content.
9. Please respect your fellow users. Do not intentionally harass other users. This includes "trolling."
10. Get along with others! We understand that there are multiple types of humor, but do not excessively attack any other user on this network. Please note that sarcasm doesn't translate well over IRC.
11. Please be mindful that this is an internet chat room mostly consisting of trollX- & Yers â€“ we enjoy the fact that we can have a friendly, welcoming atmosphere for people that can also be very flirty and sexual too. If anyone asks you to back off because they feel uncomfortable from your attention or words, please feel mindful that this isn't a personal attack on you but instead the person in question just wants to feel comfortable.
12. 18+ members only
13. Want to talk dirty? Do it in a PM. Want to send nudes? Do it in PM.
