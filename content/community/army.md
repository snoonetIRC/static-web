# Can you give us a description of your community?

{{< subreddit_link army >}} is a community dedicated mostly to past, present, and future members of the United States Army, although it is open to other branches of the military, service men and women from other countries, and those who are just interested in the Army and its culture. We ask each other questions about daily goings-on, share pertinent news, support one another, entertain ourselves, and have informational threads where people can ask questions about the military on an open floor. It is not official nor does it necessarily represent the opinion of the US Army.
