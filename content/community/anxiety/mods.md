**What is my job as an op?**
=======

### Help keep the channel as a safe and healing place that's enjoyable to all who stop by and/or frequent the channel. Do this by:

* Be kind, remember to mind triggers like everyone else
* Making users feel welcome (welcoming new users to the channel when you can and involving users in conversations)
* Overseeing conversations in channel and keeping an eye out for rule breakers and trolls
* Stop people that are there solely to cause trouble (trolls - those pushing buttons on purpose) or anyone harassing another user
* Also by being a voiced user it lets other users know you are someone to PM if they are having issues either personal, or in the channel
* For any user that seems to be or claims to be suicidal, refer them to the suicide hotline 1 (800) 273-8255 - National Suicide Prevention Lifeline or http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html. We are not professionals. If the problem persists, warn them that you will have to mute or ban them, if they persist; remove their chat privilege with !mute or !ban

### When issues come up what is the protocol for dealing with them?

**If you are online and available to users, stay oped in the channel, and de-oped if you are offline, busy, or otherwise unavailable.** To op yourself just type in: `!op` and `!deop` to de-op yourself.

* Use your discretion when dealing with problematic users. Sometimes a simple topic change could handle the situation. Sometimes a user may deserve a warning. Sometimes a user will not relent until they are banned. You may choose to PM a user about their behavior or maybe just gently prod them in channel. However you choose to do it, a warning is preferred before any more severe action. Try referring people to the link to [#anxiety rules](/anxietyrules) in the topic. Typically, the process should be:
 1. Warning (You may do this as many times as you feel necessary)
 2. Removal (You may do this as many times as you feel necessary)
 3. Ban  (If a user returns after being banned, contact Snoonet staff as it is against Snoonet policy)
* Use [this](http://goo.gl/g31KqZ) document to track troublemakers.
* Please try to include a reason and/or expiration for your bans when appropriate. Expiration is specified as an integer followed by one of d (days), h (hours), or m (minutes). Combinations (such as 1h30m) are not permitted.
* Feel free to discuss issues with your fellow ops/voiced users in #anxietymods.
* Support each other and work as a team.
* Any major issues should be brought to the attention of Snoonet staff. You can find some staff in #anxiety, but if no one is available try #help.


### Know these commands:

* To remove a user from the chat: `/remove nickname #anxiety [reason]` This overrides any auto-join the user has set up for when they are kicked. They may still re-enter the channel.
* To ban a user you may use any one of the following:
 1. `/msg chanserv BAN #anxiety [expiration] *!*@host [reason]`
 2. `/mode #anxiety +b *!*@host`
 3. `/tban #anxiety +expiration *!*@host`
 4. `!ban nickname`

* You must still either remove or kick with the first three options. To do so:
 1. `/msg chanserv KICK #anxiety nickname` OR
 2. `!kick nickname`
* To unban a user: `/msg chanserv UNBAN #anxiety *!*@host`
* To view channel bans: `/mode #anxiety +b`
* To see if a user is logged into the channel on multiple nicks: `/msg sysop .check USERNAME`
