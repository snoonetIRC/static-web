{{< subreddit_link Anxiety >}} is a supportive community for all things anxiety related. Rules can be found on the sidebar however a brief rundown would be:
As a supportive community we take racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, [ableist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism) or just generally offensive messages seriously and therefore posts or replies with such will be removed. Contact the moderators if you disagree with a message or post being removed.
When asking a specific question, it would helpful if you provide your general info(age, gender, type of anxiety, trigger examples, medications (if any), country, no insurance, etc.)

As a rule of thumb: If your anxiety is interfering with how you want to live your everyday life, if it is preventing you from doing things you want to do, or if you now run your life around your anxiety, you should get an evaluation and consider therapy.

[We are not psychiatrists or psychologists, and we cannot diagnose you or give medical advice](http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_medical_information_disclaimer), we can only share our own experiences.

Please no advertising of "quick fix" products/ideas. If you are wanting to post about something that may be viewed as such message the moderators to run it by beforehand.
