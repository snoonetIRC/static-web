# Can you give us a description of your community?

##electronic is created for members all across the Snoonet network to have a place to discuss and share their Electronic Music finds. The channel is going to be a place where fans of eletronic music can all share their music. The channel itself has a subwatch bot which has a plethora of electronic findings and has a few subs equipped to share music. Some of those include EDM, Chillstep and ElectronicMusic. However, we are always looking forward to expanding our collection and would encourage any and every newcomer to share their music. We may not be at our keyboards all the time! but we will reply eventually.
