### Can you give us a description of your community: what it's about, what rules you may have and any resources you would like to include?

Its about people. About people who had out of body experiences (aka astral projections) and a place for them to express that. Its also for people wants to learn about them. We are the biggest subreddit in this niche. Mainly because our founders came together from three different subreddits with the same niche. We are happy to serve 4K people as of the time of writing this.

### What inspired this community?

A year or two back there were 3 (including this one) astral projection related subreddits. I use to frequent this one and sent a message to the mod of this sub(at that time) that I can help with css if he ever needs it. But that mod abandoned the sub and never got my message. Then as luck would have it , a new mod (/u/lobob123 ) took over this sub. /u/lobob123 read my message and replied back saying he was happy to receive any css help. I (/u/DaMan123456 ) of course accepted and did my best to upgrade the css and clean the sub. I really wanted to help out. While we were chatting and working on making {{< subreddit_link AstralProjection >}} the best we could make it, we thought "why don't we merge all the other related subs into one? This way we can a)serve more people and b) have all the information in one place." And then me and /u/lobob123 set out do exactly that. We told our vision to make one big subreddit to /u/Captain_Midnight who at the time was running {{< subreddit_link OutOfBody >}}. It was the second biggest to our sub. He was very kind and went along with the merger. Then came /r/astralprojectionnow. This sub had no mods, so I become the mod of this sub and then redirected everyone to /r/AstralProjection. Along the way we recieved help from /u/Psichonaut . So us four mods share a really cool connection in making all of this possible. But its mainly thanks to our readers we are here.

*So TLDR: A desire to help out and a desire to be one big repository to and for all astral projection / out of body experience related thigns made this sub what it is.*
