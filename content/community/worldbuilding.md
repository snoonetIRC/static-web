#worldbuilding is a DIY community centered on the activity of creating fictional worlds, either for fun or as part of the process of writing, making a tabletop RPG, or similar. All genres and experience levels are welcome. We also serve as an off-topic social space for the {{< subreddit_link worldbuilding >}} community more generally.

Our community is small, intimate, and depth-focused. To this end, we are actively moderated in order to maintain an environment that is pleasant, productive, and conducive to detailed discussion. Because we are a DIY-focused community, we ask that you don't try to get us to make content for you.

A number of our users are experts in particular fields, and we try to be helpful. Feel free to come to us for criticism, or to give feedback to others.
