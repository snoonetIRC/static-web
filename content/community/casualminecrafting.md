**Can you give us a description of your community?**

We're a group of like-minded dedicated Minecraft players who love to engage in casual gameplay and discussion. The more the merrier.

**What sets your community apart from others?**

We're one of the few Minecraft servers out there that really try hard to maintain that old-school feeling of community. You may watch YouTubers play on servers like Mindcrack and Hermitcraft and wish you could play on such a rich and inviting server, but they're both very locked down. Well, wish no longer!

**What is your goal with this community?**

To make sure everyone has fun playing a game that they love.

**What is your community (in)famous for?**

Selfie threads.

**What is the most popular post of all time in the subreddit?**

Currently it is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualminecrafting/comments/2y9ynk/bull_shit/) titled "Bull. Shit."

**What have you learned from being a part of this community?**

That if you build it - they will come.

**Does your community have any traditions or special events?**

Right now we've only done it once, but we had a Christmas in July event this year. I hope it can continue on as a tradition.

Every few weeks we host a UHC match (Ultra Hardcore survival) on the weekend. That's always a ton of fun.

**Does your community have any associated social media or websites? (facebook/twitter/instagram/etc)**

None other than reddit/IRC
