CAHbot runs games of [Cards Against Humanity](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) on IRC.  Like an adult version of Apples to Apples or Mad Libs, players are provided with a random sentence to complete (black cards) and fill it in with words or phrases in their hand (white cards).  Each player takes a turn being the "Card Czar" - that is, the person that doesn't play a card that round, but instead selects the winner.

CAHbot is run by [bloodygonzo](/bloodygonzo) on Snoonet, and is a [fork](https://github.com/snoonetIRC/irc-cah) of a project by [teelhi](https://github.com/teeli/irc-cah).

## Where Can I Play?

CAHBot is currently set up in {{< webchat channel="##cah" title="##cah" >}} on Snoonet.  You can join a public game in this channel, or **/query bloodygonzo** and arrange for your channel to host a private game.

**!stop** - Stops the currently running game.

**!play # (#)** - Plays a card from your hand, # being the number of the card in the list. Play as many numbers separated by spaces as the current card requires.

**!pick # (#)**  - Same as **!play # (#)** above.

### When you are the "Card Czar":

**!winner #** - Picks the winner of the round, # being the number of the entry in the list. Only for the current Card Czar.

### OTHER COMMANDS
