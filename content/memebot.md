memebot is an IRC bot that places a caption on an image and uploads it to imgur. There's a variety of images you may choose from, otherwise memebot will pick one at random.

memebot was made by [Paradox](http://www.paradox.io/), who also runs the bot on Snoonet. The github for memebot can be found [here](https://github.com/paradox460/memebot) and is available under an [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## How do I get imagebot in my channel?

**/invite memebot** - If you are a channel operator or have invite privileges, just /invite memebot to your channel as you would any other user.

## What are the commands?

**!meme [m:memename] \<toptext\>;\<bottomtext\>** - Creates a meme. The semicolon is required and separates the top and bottom text, although you may leave either blank.

**!memes** - Lists the image names available to be specified with the `m:memename` parameter.  A current list of meme images available can be found [here](https://github.com/paradox460/memebot/tree/master/memes).
