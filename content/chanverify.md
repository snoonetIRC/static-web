## Why you're here
If you were sent a message from 'sysop' about viewing a web page to participate in a chat, it is because that channel is in a secure setting, most likely due to spam, bots, or trolls.

The website 'http://verify.snoonet.org' is a Snoonet controlled server, and is used to validate clients when they join a channel.

This tool was created to help protect channels from unwanted spam, and to troll the people trolling your communities.

Snoonet.org suggests speaking with the channel operators of the secure channels to have them add an auto-voice on you, so that this will no longer be an inconvenience for you.
