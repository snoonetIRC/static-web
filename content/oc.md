Welcome!

The days are finally here. Snoonet and orangechat have made it simple to bring live chat to your subreddits, and for your moderators to easily manage it! Your subreddit chat will be accessible through IRC using an IRC client, and through a much simpler messenger better suited for the mainstream public.

# Here's what orangechat has to offer you and how Snoonet utilizes it:
- No registration: just connect directly using your reddit account. We never have access to your password, and you never need to provide an email address.
- Easy to use: no commands to remember and no prior knowledge required - we're trying to keep it simple - no one should need a manual to join or moderate a chatroom.
- Connects with reddit.com: integrating with reddit lets us make some things very simple - for example, subreddit moderators are detected automatically, and can immediately begin managing the chatroom (including bans and invites).
- Private messages, private chatrooms: turn a private message into a private chatroom by inviting other friends to the conversation. You can also rename your private chatrooms, making it easy to keep track of friends and teamsâ€¦ or just express yourself ;)
- IRC link: Many subreddits already have existing IRC chatrooms and we want to help you keep all of your subreddit chat in one place. orangechat works directly with Snoonet which specifically serves the reddit community. Orangechat simply links existing channels on Snoonet with orangechat channels. Users comfortable with IRC can stay part of the conversation using any client of their choice while others can connect through orangechat.
- Support much higher numbers of users without flooding IRC channels. People are only shown on IRC if they have something to say. Channels become as public as reddit posts are.
- Works on mobile phones and tablets with ease. Just visit the orangechat website and click to join.


# Once ready, how will users get started with orangechat?
- Install the browser extension from https://orangechat.io
- Use direct subreddit link: https://app.orangechat.io/#/r/subredditname
- Visiting the web application directly at https://app.orangechat.io/

Works great on the desktop or phones!


# When will it be ready?
We are looking to enable the IRC link for all channels that have opted into the orangechat/snoonet link on the 10th June. We have listed most of the channels already on Snoonet with their associated subreddits below - just log in to prepare your channel with orangechat.

# Announcing orangechat to your subreddits
The existing subreddits that have taken it onboard to trial orangechat has had great success in making their users aware of the new chat services.

We have sidebar buttons (/r/orangechat for an example) and template announcement posts available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/noeatnosleep/wiki/orangechat)

Subreddits have modified the announcement post template and and stickied it for a few days to make sure people are aware. Since you already have an IRC channel, making sure that they are aware that orangechat simply makes it easier to connect to the channel is key!
