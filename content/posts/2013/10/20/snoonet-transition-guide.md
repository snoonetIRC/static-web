type: "post"
---

With the move to InspIRCd, Snoonet now offers channel operators and users more ways to control their chat experience, regardless of client. Some things will have changed since we moved from the old network, and in order to make the transition as pain-free as possible, we have prepared this guide to help. If you have any problems, please don't hesitate to drop by #help on irc.

This guide is broken down into multiple parts. Changes affecting channel operators are listed first, while user-level changes are listed second. Services are **not** changing, so this guide does not cover any services (eg Nickserv, Chanserv)

# Channel Modes
Most of the standard IRC channel modes will stay the same. Your bans will still work. Your invite exceptions *may* still work.

However, things depending on old network features, such as quiets and ext-bans (such as the account ban, commonly used for invite exceptions, `$a:Paradox` for example) will not. The features are not gone, don't worry, they just work differently now.

### Changes

### Quiets
Many channels used `+q` to maintain a list of users who are prevented from speaking in the channel, but may still join and leave freely. This mode has been removed on the new network, and has been replaced with an extended ban.

To quiet people on inspircd, you use the `m` extended ban. See the table below for some examples of how `q` bans on the old network become mute bans on the new network:

|                    Old                     |                  New                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `+q *!*@snoonet/operations/Paradox`        | `+b m:*!*@snoonet/operations/Paradox` |
| `+q *!*@192.168.1.1`                       | `+b m:*!*@192.168.1.1`                |
| `+q NickName!*@*`                          | `+b m:NickName!*@*`                   |
| `+q $~a` (quiets all non-registered users) | `+M` (not a ban, a chanmode)          |
| `+q $a:Paradox` (account ban)              | `+b m:R:Paradox`                      |

### Bans, Extbans, and Invite Exceptions (+b, +e, and +I)
Bans share many of the same syntax as quiets, which are listed above, and you can just omit the `m:` from the ban to make them apply as bans.

|        Name        |             Old              |       New       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Registered user    | `$a`                         | `R:*`           |
| Account name       | `$a:AccountName`             | `R:AccountName` |
| Channel match      | `$c:#chan`                   | `j:#chan`       |
| Oper               | `$o`                         | `O:*`           |
| realname           | `$r:realname`                | `r:realname`    |
| Can access channel | `$j:#chan`                   | *n/a*           |
| Ban + realname     | `$x:nick!user@host#realname` | *n/a*           |
| SSL users          | `$z`                         | `z:*`           |


*Some extban changes introduce new features, while others can reproduce the old features using a combination of `+b` and `+e` modes. See the [Modes](/modes) page for details*

### Other modes
With the transition we have lost some modes, gained some new ones, and others have changed. They are listed below. If a mode is not listed, it should be the same

|         Name         | Old  |         New          |
| -------------------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| Registered Join only | `+r` | `R`                  |
| Strip color codes    | `+c` | `S`                  |
| Anyone can Invite    | `+g` | `A`                  |
| Light Moderated      | `+z` | *n/a*                |
| Forward              | `+f` | `+b *!*@*#otherchan` |
| Free Target          | `+F` | *n/a*                |

*Some channel mode changes introduce new features, while others are still possible using a combination of `+b` and `+e` modes with extbans. See the [Modes](/modes) page for details*

## New features

### Channel Modes
