We are pleased to announce that [KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/) now allows you to connect with Snoonet's bouncer (BNC) service.  Web BNC can be accessed at [https://webbnc.snoonet.org](https://webbnc.snoonet.org).  This change should enable more users to access our BNC service and use it on a regular basis.  

Prawnsalad, creator of [KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/), has been working closely with our development team in order to make this possible.  We would like to thank prawnsalad for his effort and his contributions to Snoonet.  It is always a pleasure to work with someone who goes the extra mile to improve the user experience for our community.

- **What is a BNC?**  
    A BNC (or Bouncer) is a service which keeps you connected to IRC 24/7. Instead of connecting directly to Snoonet, you connect to the bouncer, which stays connected. The bouncer will play back messages which you missed while you were disconnected. This way, you can always be part of the conversation.
- **How do I get one?**  
    Once you have a nick registered with NickServ for one month, you are eligible to request a BNC. You need to join ##bnc and type */requestbnc*. Then, wait for an operator to approve your request. Usually this is done within an hour or two. When your request is approved, details on connecting to your account will be sent to your account via MemoServ. To read them, type */ms read new*

Please see [our BNC page](/bnc) for more information on Snoonet's BNC service.
