title: "Change to the Default User Modes on Snoonet"
type: "post"
---

We know that many communities are concerned about privacy for their users.  To that end, in addition to masking user's IPs, we are now setting +I as a default usermode. 

## What does this mean?

Unless you /umode -I, users will now be unable to see channels that you are in.  If you wish -I to persist, please type /msg nickserv keepmodes on

## Looking for new channels?

If you are looking to find new channels, please visit [the communities page](/communities).

If you'd like your channel to be added to this list, please ask in {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} or submit a ticket [here](https://support.snoonet.org).
