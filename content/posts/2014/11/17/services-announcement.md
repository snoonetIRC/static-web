With the recent announcement of the end of major development of the Atheme IRC services suite, Snoonet has made the decision to convert the network to the Anope 2.0 services suite. This change will take affect on January 1st, 2015. Generally, there will be no change in the way you operate your channels, however, there are some differences in the services packages.

A conversion guide will be written in the near future, and Snoonet will assist channel ops one on one, if necessary, to make the transition as seamless as possible. We will provide updates in the near future. Please join #anopeconversion if you have any questions. Thank you for your continued patronage.
