# From: Snoonet Management

Snoonet is recruiting volunteers for the Community Guide position.

We are looking for helpers that will be available to answer questions about Snoonet and [orangechat](https://orangechat.io) in #help and in #orangechat.

Community Guides will be responsible for guiding Snoonet users with any help requests.

## What is orangechat?

Orangechat is a webchat that integrates directly with reddit.com. You can use your reddit account to connect directly to chatrooms and chat with other users browsing your favorite subreddits.

- Orangechat will bring new communities to Snoonet in the form of an easy-to-access interface directly from reddit.com.
- Orangechat allows existing Snoonet communities to link their subreddit's to Snoonet via orangechat so no one is left out.

## How can I apply?

For more information and instructions on applying, see our [Guide Recruitment page](/recruit-guides). Applications will be open until June 12, 2016.
