Snoonet is proud to introduce Calvin (London) and Hobbes (Singapore) to the network! These additional servers in Europe and Asia, respectively, will provide a more stable and faster connection for our users outside of North America. *eu-irc.snoonet.org* has been updated to include the new European server, and we have added *asiapac-irc.snoonet.org* for our users in the Asia-Pacific region. DNS records have been updated accordingly and these new changes will take effect next time you connect.

We have also added a new hub in Europe to increase reliability. This will ensure that users outside of North America are not as affected by maintenance and remain connected to each other in the rare event of a netsplit.

If you have any questions, please ask a staff member in {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} and remember, "It's a wonderful world Hobbes ol' buddy... Let's go exploring!"
