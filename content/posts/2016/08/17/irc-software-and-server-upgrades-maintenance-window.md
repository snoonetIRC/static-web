title: "IRC software and Server upgrades (Maintenance Window)"
type: "post"
---

Snoonet will be undergoing server updates on the morning of August 31st at 02:00 UTC. The maintenance window will last for approximately 4 hours (subject to change, sudden catastrophic failure, and/or ThatOneRoadie pouring maple syrup on the Canadian servers).

We will be performing some operating system patching and updates, as well as patching our IRC daemon to the latest version, and recompiling some network-wide modules. During this time, some netsplits will occur as servers are brought down for maintenance and upgraded. We will be performing our updates in batches, so if you experience a disconnection, you will be able to immediately reconnect to another server via irc.snoonet.org.

Thanks for the patience, and as always, feel free to bug us in {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} if you have any questions.
