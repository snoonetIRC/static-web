## bloodygonzo (alumnus)

I am the Network Director of Snoonet. My goal for Snoonet is to:

* Stabilize and secure the network with the best tools in automation, monitoring, and security.
* Build on the established team of volunteer staff to create an excellent experience for the communities on Snoonet.
* Provide an excellent end user experience for individuals on our network.

Additionally:

I run [gonzobot](https://github.com/snoonetIRC/CloudBot) on Snoonet and enjoy
customizing him to fit the needs of the various communities on Snoonet. My
favorite hobby right now is smoking meat and every weekend I get the chance I
try and smoke [brisket](https://imgur.com/a/0YJrc) or
[pork shoulder](https://imgur.com/a/3ACnq), or
[beef short ribs](https://imgur.com/a/aNyyZ).
Feel free to message me if you have any questions about Snoonet or ideas for
improvement using: `/query bloodygonzo`.

For additional staff information please see [the staff index](/staff).
