# Duck {{< email "duck" >}}

Hello all, Duck here! Thanks for flying Snoonet!

I joined staff in mid 2017 and presently oversee operations on the network as the Network Director. Part of my mission is to assist our [staff](/staff) with rules & guideline enforcement and to assist in the maintenance of our server infrastructure. I'm also involved with [InspIRCd](https://www.inspircd.org/), whose software powers this network.

While not doing network-related things, I may be found chatting in a handful of the [communities](/communities) that we host. If you see me around, feel free to say hi, or send me a message at any time using **/msg Duck Hi**!
