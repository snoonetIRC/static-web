Aloha! I am duk242

I've been on IRC for about 20 years now (Snoonet since 2017).

I chill in the #techsupport, #programming, #technology and #games channels for the most part.

IRL I'm an Aussie who likes games, gadgets and casual programming.

Feel free to say hi! I'm always up for a random chat about tech support, games or whatever.
