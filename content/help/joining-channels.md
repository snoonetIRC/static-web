Many clients come with interfaces to join channels "more easily", but really the easiest way to do this is the native IRC way. In IRC most stuff goes through so-called "Slash-Commands", sounds complicated but it's really not - all it means is that stuff you preceed with a slash (/) will not be sent to channels or people but instead be sent to the server as a command.

To join a channel you can type ``/join #channelname`` in the IRC client, web or desktop - it's the same for every client. This will join you into any channel, whether it exists or not. You can use the command when you are on a channel or in your server information window (where the MOTD came up) or even in private message windows. It's super easy and I believe it's a lot easier than going through some bloated channel interface.

You can also use `/list` to see all the channels available.

All clients will keep a list of channels you are in, our webchat does that above the chat, most desktop clients do it in a sidebar on the left or the right.
