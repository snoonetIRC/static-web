IRC is a fairly popular chat protocol, it has many thousands of users around the world. It's no surprise that the choice of clients is huge. There's IRC clients for every operating system and most of them are free.

Choosing an IRC client comes down to preference, but here are some of the more popular ones:

* [AdiIRC](https://www.adiirc.com/index.php) (Free - WIndows/Mac OS/Linux)
* [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) (Free - Mac OS)
* [HexChat](http://hexchat.github.io/) (Free - Windows/Mac OS/Linux)
* [IceChat](http://www.icechat.net/site/) (Free - WIndows)
* [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) (Free - Mac OS/Linux - Command line client/Advanced)
* [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) (Free - Mac OS)
* [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) (Paid - Windows)
* [Smuxi](https://www.smuxi.org/main/) (Free - Windows/Mac OS/Linux)
* [Textual](http://www.codeux.com/textual/) (Paid - Mac OS)
* [weechat](http://weechat.org) (Free - Mac OS/Linux - Command line client/Advanced)

All these clients are different (some more, some less) but they all have some stuff in common. They all allow for storing a list of networks and for setting global information about yourself, like a nickname and your real name (you don't have to put your actual name there, you can put anything in the real name field). So you should choose your desired nickname and move on to the next steps.
