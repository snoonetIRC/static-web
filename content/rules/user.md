## Nicknames / NickServ

+ Available names may be freely registered with NickServ so long as they do not violate network policy.
+ There is a maximum of 5 grouped nicknames per account. Use [NickServ](/anope#NickServ)'s GROUP command as opposed to REGISTER.
+ Nickname squatting is not permitted. We ask that all registered or grouped names be put to use.
+ Your nickname may not contain any racial slurs or bigotry. Names in violation of this are subject to being dropped and/or prohibited, with repeat offenders being banned.
+ Temporary/disposable email addresses are prohibited. Snoonet reserves the right to delete your registration if you register with a false/throwaway email address.
+ By default, nicknames have an insane expiration date. Upon request in the {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}} channel, single accounts with only 1 name and at least 1 year of inactivity may be dropped. Nicknames grouped (/NS GROUP) to any single account may be ungrouped/dropped after at least 6 months of inactivity. Requests for nicknames to be dropped will be subject to staff discretion. Requests for nicknames that violate Snoonet guidelines will be refused.

## Hostmasks

+ You will receive an initial hostmask when you connect to Snoonet. This hostmask does not show your IP address. When you register an account with Snoonet and confirm your registration via e-mail, you will receive a default user cloak. If you do not wish to have a user cloak after confirming your name, please ask for it to be removed in {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}}.
+ For channels of a specific size, vanity hosts may be available.  At this time, this option is available for users with specific privileges in channels with fifty (50) users or more.  Please visit #help for assistance.
+ Custom vanity hosts are not offered except in special circumstances, such as network events.

## Bots

+ You may freely run an IRC bot on this network, providing that it conforms to our terms of service and other network rules as outlined both above and below. Bots should have their own registered account and must have a user/USERNAME/bot/BOTNAME vhost. You may also wish to set the +B user mode on your bot so it may be identified as a bot on the network. For assistance in getting your bot up and running, please join #help and someone will be happy to assist you.
