## Registering a Channel

+ Channels may be freely registered and/or opened on Snoonet so long as they do not violate network policy.
+ If you would like to claim an abandoned channel please /join #help and request assistance. Channels no longer in use may be dropped.  This is offered as a privilege and not a right, and such decisions are subject to staff discretion.
+ Snoonet has the right to suspend or close any channels that encourage illegal activity or otherwise expose the network to liability.
+ Unicode channel names are not allowed.
+ A maximum of 10 channels may be registered by a single user.
+ Please do not mass register channels that have no meaning or to "reserve" a channel you do not intend on using. These channels are subject to being dropped; repeat offenders may be banned.

## Logging
+ Private logging of channels is permitted unless explicitly prohibited by a specific channel. Snoonet requests that channel logs not be made public unless consent has been given by the channel in question.
