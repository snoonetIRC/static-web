## Network-Wide Rules

+ Repeated and/or intentional ban evasion may earn you a timed network ban. To
  request a ban appeal, follow the policy of appeals (where one exists) or
  message the banning OP. Bans from Snoonet network channels or the Snoonet IRC
  network in its entirety must be addressed via
  [support ticket](https://support.snoonet.org).
+ Please respect your fellow users. Do not intentionally harass other users.
  This includes "trolling". Action may be taken on a channel-to-channel basis,
  where such rules exist. If harassment is persistent, across multiple channels
  or targets a specific user for a length of time, the offending user may be
  banned.
+ Get along with others! We understand that there are multiple types of humor,
  but do not excessively attack any other user on this network. Please note that
  sarcasm doesn't translate well over IRC.
+ Posting the personal information of others is grounds for a permanent network
  ban. Attempting to collect personal info of users is dealt with in the same
  manner.
+ No solicitation. This includes, but is not limited to, public spam, private
  message spam, repeated solicitation of services, solicitation of other network
  channels, and vote brigading on social media (eg. encouraging others to
  upvote/downvote a thread on reddit).
+ Solicitation of services for financial gain is only permitted by asking the
  channel operators.
+ No user is to request money from others. While we understand many are in times
  of need, please register a gofundme account and state why you are asking for
  money. Please ask permission from the channel operators. Begging, and
  contacting multiple users requesting money is a network offense and will be
  dealt with warnings and removal from the network.
+ Listen to network staff. They can be identified by the "snoonet/rank/nickname"
  hostmask. `/whois NICKNAME` to confirm that they are a Snoonet staff member.
  You can view the staff directory [here](/staff)
+ Do not ignore network operators or channel operators. If you have an issue
  with the conduct of a network operator, kindly open an "Abuse" support ticket
  and your complaint will be noted and addressed. Issues with the conduct of an
  operator in a specific channel should be addressed with that channel directly.
+ User impersonation is prohibited. If you're found to be intentionally
  impersonating Snoonet users, you may face removal from the network for a
  length of time to be decided at the time of incident.

## For Your Information

+ Please don't spam/flood the network. If you need to paste a large chunk of
  text, consider https://pastebin.com/. Automated
  tools are in use that have the capability of accidentally banning innocent
  flooders.
+ If a channel is getting spammed and no operators are around, or if you just
  need help with something network-related, join
  {{< webchat channel="#help" title="#help" >}}.
