## False-Positive Bans

If you were lead here through IRC, your address is set to be auto-banned on connect due to a malicious user ban evading.

The reason and example:

Malicious user uses address `1an9-2b4a-3216-41k.example.com`.

We ban `1an9-2b4a-3216-41k.example.com`.

User changes their IP address/hostmask to be `22-2b.61.72.41.example.com` to evade the original ban.

Since we don't want to block access to all of (in this example) `*!*@*.example.com`, we apply bans through a service bot, which will allow us to give your specific nickname, identd, and IP address exemptions. Sometimes we will see that it's a false-positive and automatically give you an exemption.

Some users are malicious and try to ruin it for many others, however we are here for you! If you don't know what any of this means, we'll handle all the technical stuff for you! Here's what to do.

## What to do

For us to add an exemption so that you are not banned. Please e-mail {{< email "support" >}} with your IP address (www.whatismyip.com and copy your IP) the identd that you connect with (If you don't know what it is, state so in the e-mail) and your IRC nickname so we may add an exemption for you specifically. We will e-mail you back within a few minutes and you will be able to connect to our services.

Sorry for the inconvenience
