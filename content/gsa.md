## Seeking Game Admins

We are seeking a few active game server administrators for a 32-man TF2 and 16-man Garry's Mod server. As of now, these are the two servers that we will host. If you have other suggestions for games and feel that they'll be popular and widely supported, please e-mail {{< email "support" >}} with the subject line "Game Server Inquiry." Please include your suggestion and why you feel the game server should be hosted.
