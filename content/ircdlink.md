## Looking to link with our IRC network?

We currently have ~15 servers at any given time with multiple backup systems and spare servers in case of catastrophe. We are strictly FOR communities, Subreddits and otherwise. If you are looking to link and our admin team agrees, you must adhere to our staff rules (which will be discussed in a meeting with you). We will schedule a meeting with you and your staff to make sure we're all on the same page and share similar goals. Your server/network does not need to be established already, however we run InspIRCd and Atheme.

Modmail applications to {{< subreddit_link snoonet >}}.


## Include in the e-mail:

* Your IRC alias
* First Name, Initial last name
* Your age. Currently we ask for 20 years of age and above.
* Location (City or State, Country) that you reside in.
* Locations of server(s) if more than one
* Amount of IRC Operators your network has. We are very strict and keep these privileges to a minimum, and hire only when we need the extra help
* Operating systems, CPU type, amount of usable memory, and bandwidth of server(s): If you're looking to provide a server on a stable vps, InspIRCd will not run well under OpenVz.
* Experience with InspIRCd and Atheme services, as well as experience as an IRC Operator on a network with greater than 2000 users.
* Experience and knowledge with the Linux operating system (on a scale of 1-10)
* How chill and open minded you are you are on a 1-10 scale. We only like chill people.
* Any programming languages you might know (this is not a requirement, but we are a team that helps with many projects)
* Current user base if any (if your network is already established)
* Any extra reasoning behind wanting to link with our network.
