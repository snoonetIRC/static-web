**Maintain Badwords:**

To add a word to the badwords list

`/msg BotServ BADWORDS <channel> ADD <word> [SINGLE | START | END]`

To delete a word from the badwords list

`/msg BotServ BADWORDS <channel> DEL {word | entry-num | list}`

To display the badwords list

`/msg BotServ BADWORDS <channel> LIST [mask | list]`

To clear all entries from the badwords list

`/msg BotServ BADWORDS <channel> CLEAR`

*Maintains the bad words list for a channel. This list determines which words users are to be kicked for using when the bad words kicker is enabled.*

---

**Say command:**

`/msg BotServ SAY <channel> <text>`

*Makes the bot say the given text on the given channel.*

---

**Act command:**

`/msg BotServ ACT <channel> <text>`

*Makes the bot do the equivalent of a "/me" command on the given channel using the given text.*

---

**Unassign a bot:**

`/msg BotServ UNASSIGN <channel>`

*Unassigns the assigned bot from the channel. When you use this command, the bot won't join the channel anymore. However, bot configuration for the channel is kept, so you will always be able to reassign a bot later without having to reconfigure it entirely.*
