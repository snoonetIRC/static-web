    <section class="content"><h1 id="irc-news">IRC News</h1>
<p>On Wednesday, Jan. 16 we will be issuing patches and features for the 
<a href="https://webchat.snoonet.org/">Snoonet Webchat</a>. We are creating a backend for channels to be managed through a webpanel which will be the alpha stage for reddit/other communities&rsquo; users to remotely set up/modify/view/update their community&rsquo;s IRC channel access lists and settings, including ban lists and invex lists. For other IRC networks out there, check out <a href="http://www.kiwiirc.com">www.kiwiirc.com</a> as the developer has a lot of goals and a lot of options available to bring a live webchat to your network.</p>
<p>We will be creating a few customized IRC bots that will offer a variety of options for different types of communities.</p>
<p>Some examples will be a VIP-Ask Me Anything robot which will moderate the channel, and accept questions for VIPs to answer directly. The system will work by users submitting a question, and a moderator will approve the question. The questions will remain in a queue until the user is voiced, the bot states the question and the VIP and the user have a short period of time to ask and answer questions before moving on. All questions, answers, and conversation will be compiled in to a markup post which can easily be posted (or automatically) to a reddit thread where the Ask Me Anything thread may possibly continue.</p>
<p>A channel protection bot for channel operators/moderators to utilize and change the settings of to set a &lsquo;bad words&rsquo; type filter list, where they may set punishments for bad words, phrases, links, etc. The bot will also have options to control punishing flooding/repeat lines/repeat offenders, as well as manage the ban lists. This is for channels that grow in size and need moderation while operators/mods aren&rsquo;t around. For those familiar with our network bot &lsquo;sysop&rsquo; - it will be a user controlled/managed bot controlled by channel mods.</p>
<p>While the above may be boring/uninteresting to some,</p>
<h1 id="games">Games</h1>
<p>Our network co-founder Paradox and network operator, Ricin will be hosting a large-scale Minecraft server for users to play on. More news will be posted about it as they will require help in moderating the server/keeping an eye on things. If you have any suggestions for other games you&rsquo;d like hosted, feel free to contact us in 
<a href="https://webchat.snoonet.org/#SnoonetGaming">SnoonetGaming</a>, 

    <a href="https://reddit.com/r/irc">/r/irc</a> or e-mail <span class="email-link">support [at] snoonet.org</span>.</p>
<p>We have the resources to host multiple game servers, and will be hosting these servers while we code and produce the competitive gaming tournament aspect of Snoonet.org, where teams can compete in games to win cash, or play for free to win smaller prizes. <a href="/mission-statement">More can be read in our mission statement!</a>.</p>
<p>So in the upcoming days, you&rsquo;ll see a few changes to the webchat, as well as us announcing our Minecraft / other server information.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions/questions, we can be contacted on IRC in 
<a href="https://webchat.snoonet.org/#snoonet">#snoonet</a> - <span class="email-link">support [at] snoonet.org</span> or 

    <a href="https://reddit.com/r/irc">/r/irc</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, and making Snoonet possible!</p>

    <section class="content"><p>On Monday, Jan. 7 at 2AM EST we will be issuing updates to the Snoonet IRCd servers.</p>
<p>There will be some brief splits as we upgrade the operating systems on two of the nodes. We will be adding more nodes for clients to connect to for both IPv4 and IPv6. As our webchat reaches a more capable stage, these updates will be to prepare for the widespread user count anticipated by newcomers from Reddit Enhancement Suite/Reddit links.</p>
<p>We will keep services downtime to a minimum, anticipating very little downtime.</p>
<p>Snoonet is working on other projects aside from IRC/live chat services, and more news will be shared as the days come.</p>
<p>We are also seeking client servers. We have plenty of servers, but we feel as if they will be of use in the very near future. If you can help, please e-mail <span class="email-link">shane [at] snoonet.org</span> and we will continue from there. Please have advanced knowledge and experience moderating large communities!</p>
<p>Snoonet is here for ALL communities, reddit and otherwise. If you&rsquo;d like to help us provide for the communities, shoot us an e-mail!</p>
<p>If you have any concerns/questions, feel free to post at <a href="http://snoonet.reddit.com">http://snoonet.reddit.com</a> / e-mail us at <span class="email-link">support [at] snoonet.org</span> / ask us in #help</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Snoonet Staff</p>

    <section class="content"><h1 id="email-support">Email Support</h1>
<p>We have set up an e-mail for those in need of support if they are having connection issues, or need any type of support outside of the chat network. Any suggestions or requests for any thing Snoonet are <strong>highly encouraged</strong> as well. This can be done by contacting us at <span class="email-link">support [at] snoonet.org</span> - Be sure to include your nickname in the e-mail!</p>
<h1 id="keeping-in-touch">Keeping in Touch</h1>
<p>We will be announcing things as we work on them via wallops (/mode yournick +w) for those interested, and discussing things in #snoonet - Recently we changed the default connect mode so users may opt in to these messages, rather than having to opt-out for things they are not concerned with.</p>
<h1 id="webchat">Webchat</h1>
<p>Snooonet webchat will be greatly updated. Much more stable and integrated more with the reddit lifestyle you know and love. It should be easier for everybody to use. We have made sure that all your existing webchat links will still work as normal so no need to worry about that.</p>
<p>This will now pave the way for subreddit mods to embed or customize Snoonet webchat for their own communities. You may link to your IRC channel (chat room) with <code>https://webchat.snoonet.org//yourchannelhere</code></p>
<h1 id="sslfingerprint-information">SSL/Fingerprint Information</h1>
<p>Due to recent changes in the Snoonet network infrastructure, our servers now use a single, self-signed certificate for all secure (SSL) connections. For our security-conscious clients, the below fingerprints may be used to verify the identity of a Snoonet server:</p>
<p><code>99:5B:AC:FE:E6:A4:22:8F:51:2D:21:63:4B:5F:05:4D:E1:61:8D:6B</code></p>
<p>The reason for self-signing is to offer encryption and security for those who seek it while handle issues with our paid/valid certificate to work with the IRCds. Our staff has been working very hard to <strong>make things the way the need to be</strong> after the unfortunate events with the .com to .org address change.</p>
